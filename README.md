# password-Generator-in-java
This project is a Java Console Application to generate Random passwords and performing a password strength check.  I decided to build this project during the Winter Break of my second year after taking the Object-Oriented Effective Java Programming course, I wanted to build something interesting with Java to practice and see what I could do on my own. However, I still wasn't sure what I wanted to do. Then one night, I was explaining to my father the importance of having a strong password for his social media accounts I got the idea of doing a random password generator, a week later it was done. While working on it I decided to include a password strength checker feature that checks for the overall strength of the entered password and I was pretty happy with how it came out but I realised that it was not very straightforward to use for someone who does not know how it is supposed to work so I decided to create a GUI for the application for the next step it is available in the Password-Services repository
